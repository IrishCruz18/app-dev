My Beloved Summer is my favorite Korean drama that stands out for its heartfelt storytelling, relatable characters, and realistic portrayal of love and growth. Unlike many romance dramas that rely on dramatic plot twists or exaggerated emotions, this series takes a more subtle, mature approach to relationships. The story follows Choi Woong and Kook Yeon-su, two very different individuals who dated in high school but broke up under complicated circumstances. Years later, they are forced to reunite when the documentary they filmed during their school days unexpectedly gains attention online. What follows is a quiet, reflective journey of two people slowly confronting their past, understanding who they’ve become, and figuring out whether love is still possible between them. One of the most remarkable aspects of the series is its use of time. It frequently shifts between past and present, allowing viewers to witness the contrast in the characters’ personalities, emotions, and maturity. These transitions are smooth and meaningful, not just for storytelling but for showing how people change over time, and how unresolved feelings can linger even as life moves on. The chemistry between the lead actors, Choi Woo-shik and Kim Da-mi, is natural and engaging, making their characters’ connection feel authentic. Their performances show vulnerability and emotional depth without going over the top. Supporting characters also add value to the story, especially Kim Ji-ung and NJ, who each bring their own struggles and perspectives on love and identity.
Visually, the show is beautifully shot, with a soft and nostalgic tone that matches the mood of the narrative. Every frame feels carefully designed to highlight the emotions in a quiet, artistic way. The soundtrack, especially the popular track “Christmas Tree” by V (BTS), further elevates the emotional atmosphere of the series—it’s calming, sentimental, and perfectly timed with the story’s key moments. Overall, My Beloved Summer is a K-drama that leaves a lasting impression not because of intense drama, but because of its sincerity. It’s about how people grow, how miscommunication can deeply affect relationships, and how sometimes love doesn’t disappear—it just takes time to return in a different, more mature form. It’s a story that feels close to real life, and that’s what makes it so special. For anyone who enjoys slow-burn romance with depth, reflection, and meaningful character growth, My Beloved Summer is truly a must-watch.
